This is a quiz game loosely modeled after the website Sporcle. Users can create,
find and play quiz games in which they enter as many correct answers as possible in the alloted time for the quiz.
Users can see theirs and other's quiz history and scores, and each quiz shows the top 5 high scores

Heroku site can be found here: https://infinite-everglades-9127.herokuapp.com

NEXT STEPS:
Building React functinality for adding, editing, and deleting quizzes and answers for quizzes
Refactoring ruby and javascript code
Make nicer user interface
Add pause button for timer
Users can customize 'hint/solution' headers based on the quiz they're creating
Hide answer solutions in the HTML. 

MINOR BUGS:
    Rare, but sometimes timer doesn't load when user starts game
    Nothing happens the first time a user tries to submit a guess on a game. Works fine after that. Will fix when refactoring javascript
