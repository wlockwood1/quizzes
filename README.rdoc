This is a quiz game loosely modeled after the website Sporcle. Users can create, find and play quiz games in which they enter as many correct answers as possible in the alloted time for the quiz.

MAJOR TO DO:
    -Deploy heroku site
    -Install devise and allow users to sign up. App will save all games they've played
    -Rspec tests
    -Prettier user interface

MINOR BUGS:
    -Categories dropdown doesn't work after you start a game, even if you go back to main page. You have to refresh page for it to work again.
    -Rare, but sometimes timer doesn't load when user starts game
    -Nothing happens the first time a user tries to submit a guess on a game. Works fine after that
